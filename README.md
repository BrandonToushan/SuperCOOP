Welcome to the SuperCOOP repository. This repository contains Team SuperCOOP's capstone research project in its entirety. Over the course of a year the team set out to measure the superconducting gap energy of a piece of niobium tantalum-foil (and recreate the 1972 Nobel Prize Winning BCS experiment). The entirety of the research, analysis and results can be found in this repository including the final paper in .pdf format.

Over the course of the experiment, tens of thousands of unique data points were recorded, analyzed, and transformed into useable results using packages such as qexpy, numpy and scipy. The vast majority of the code located here has numerous potential applications in signal processing, semiconductor physics and optimization based used cases. In addition to this, the various fitting models contained here can be applied with minor tinkering to most non-linear equations and as a result can be used in a bevy of modelling applications.
