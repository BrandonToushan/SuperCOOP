Hello!

Welcome to my SuperCOOP repository. Just as a little bit of background, this repository contains my team and I's capstone PHYSICS 350 project in it's entirety. Over the course of a year we set out to measure the superconducting gap energy of a piece of niobium tantalum-foil. I won't get into the nitty gritty of what we did here, although if you happen to be interested in what we did please give the pdf doc containing our formal finalized report a glance over as anything and everything relating to the project is covered there.  

What you'll find here in this repository is the entire research process from the rough data taking, all the way through to the computational modelling and results analysis that was done over the course of the project. All done in python, making very good use of the Jupyter notebooks platform to keep some semblance of order to the data. Over the course of the experiement my team and I took thousands upon thousands of data points that we analyzed, manipulated and interpreted using packages such as qexpy, numpy and scipy.

Please feel free to take a look around although I will warn you that some of these scripts are a fair bit rough and lack proper documentation. The vast majority of the code you'll find has  potential applications in anything where big data sets are common. The fitting models and functions I have written here can be applied with minor tinkering to most non-linear equations and can easily be applied to modelling just about anything. 

Please don't hesitate to shoot me a message if you have any questions about my code here or superconductors in general!

Cheers,

Brandon
